# SimpleHtmlChatAgents
This is a simple HTML/javascript based chat application that uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate responses. The application allows you to choose from different agents, each with their own unique personality and style of communication.

You will need your personal OpenAi API-KEY. Get it here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

The project is created to provide you with a simple interface running a GPT chat model without the need for a server or backend. This so you can easily expand on the project and learn how to use OpenAI's API.

Aimed for local use and learning as you would publish your API key to the world if you use it on a public server.

## Installation
1. Press the green "Code" button on the project page and choose "Download ZIP" to download the project. (or [download here](https://github.com/Slamsneider/SimpleHtmlChatAgents/archive/refs/heads/main.zip))
2. Once downloaded, unzip the html folder to your desired location.
3. **RENAME** `apikey.js.install` to `apikey.js` and open the file in a text editor.
4. Replace `YOUR_API_KEY_HERE` with your OpenAI API key.
5. Save the changes made in the `apikey.js` file.
6. Now, open the `index.html` file in your browser to start using the application.

## How to Use

1. Select a model from the dropdown menu.
2. Select an agent from the dropdown menu.
3. Type your message in the input field and click the "Send" button or press Enter to send it.
4. The agent's response will appear in the chat log.
5. If you want to change to another agent, you can do so from the dropdown menu. Note that changing the agent will reset the chat history.
6. Add your own agents by editing the `agents.js` file.

## Code Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file for the application.
- `apikey.js`: Contains the API key for OpenAI's API.
- `agents.js`: Agent definitions.
- `functions.js`: Main functionality of the application, including sending messages and handling responses.
- `styles.css`: CSS styles for the application.

## About OpenAi Models and Tokens
Each model have a different total tokens available for the inference (request). One token is approximately 4 characters.

As example then `gpt-3.5-turbo` has 4096 tokens available for each request.

When sending a request, the token count consists of the following components:

- System prompt
- Conversation history
- User prompt
- `max_tokens` parameter

The sum of these components must be less than the total tokens available for the model, or else an error will occur.
### Max Tokens
The `max_tokens` parameter determines how many tokens should be reserved for the response.

### finish_reason
The `finish_reason` indicates the reason why the response ended. It can be either "stop" or "length". "Stop" means that the response had a 'normal' run, while "length" indicates that the response reached the `max_tokens` limit and is incomplete. If so, then to continue the response, you can use the word "continue" as the next prompt.

### Temperature
The temperature parameter controls the randomness of the response. Lower values will result in more predictable responses, while higher values will result in more surprising responses (hallucinations).


## ⚠️Important Note 

Do not use this application on a public server as it will expose your API key to the world. This application is intended for 'local' use only.

## Disclaimer

This application is made for learning and is not intended to be a full fledged chat application.
